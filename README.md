# PageSpeed Optimization

PageSpeed Optimization plugin performs optimization of external scripts and styles by moving them to the footer, blocking, or delaying. Loading of delayed scripts or styles begins after the first user interaction - scroll, clock, or mouse enter. Links and fonts can be preloaded to minimize loading time.

During moving, blocking, or delaying, the plugin performs exact calculations of all scripts and styles dependencies across the whole dependency tree. So, any script or style whose position has to be modified will be moved with all dependencies in the proper order. This functionality is unique and does not exist in most top-level caching plugins.

Some scripts can be stored locally: Google AdSense, Google Analytics, Google Maps, Google Tag Manager, and Yandex Metrika. Scripts for the above-mentioned services will be cached on the local server and updated twice daily.

Google Pagespeed Insights (PSI) requires leveraging browser cache when using analytics scripts because they only have a 2-hour cache expiry time. When scripts are stored locally, their cache expiry time is increased, raising the PSI score.

PageSpeed Optimization plugin will get you a higher score on Google Pagespeed Insights and make your website load faster. The most impact can usually be achieved by delaying scripts.
